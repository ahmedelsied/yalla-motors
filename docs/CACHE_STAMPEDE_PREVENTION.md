# Cache Stampede Prevention Strategy

## Overview
This implementation includes several strategies to prevent cache stampede scenarios where multiple requests simultaneously try to refresh an expired cache entry.

## Implemented Strategies

### 1. Mutex-based Prevention
- **Mutex Key**: Each cache key has an associated mutex (`{cache_key}:refresh`)
- **TTL**: Mutex expires after 5 seconds to prevent deadlocks
- **Logic**: Only one process can refresh the cache at a time

### 2. Stale-While-Revalidate Pattern
- **Max-Age**: 60 seconds (fresh content)
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: 120 seconds (serve stale content while refreshing)
- **Total Window**: 180 seconds before complete expiration

### 3. Background Refresh
- When content is stale but within the revalidate window:
  - Serve stale content immediately
  - Trigger background refresh
  - Update cache without blocking response

## Cache Lifecycle

```
Time 0s:    Content cached, fresh
Time 60s:   Content becomes stale, but still served
Time 60s+:  Background refresh triggered (if mutex available)
Time 120s:  Content becomes completely stale
Time 180s:  Cache expires, next request will be MISS
```

## Additional Considerations

### 1. Jitter (Not Implemented)
- Could add random jitter to refresh times
- Prevents synchronized refreshes across multiple servers
- Example: `refresh_time = base_time + random(0, 30)`

### 2. Early Refresh (Implemented)
- Refresh starts when content becomes stale (60s)
- Not when it completely expires (180s)
- Reduces likelihood of cache misses

### 3. Circuit Breaker (Not Implemented)
- Could prevent refresh attempts during high load
- Would serve stale content instead of attempting refresh

## Monitoring

The implementation includes observability headers:
- `X-Cache`: HIT/MISS status
- `X-Cache-Key`: Cache key used
- `X-Query-Time-ms`: Response time
- `Age`: How old the cached content is

## Production Recommendations

1. **Use Redis**: For distributed mutex and better performance
2. **Job Queue**: Move background refresh to queue workers
3. **Health Checks**: Monitor cache hit rates and refresh failures
4. **Load Testing**: Verify behavior under high concurrent load
5. **Metrics**: Track cache performance and stampede events
